### ðŸ”‘ Concepts Covered
### Components
Components are the building blocks of React applications. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces. This project uses functional components, which are simpler and easier to manage.

#### Reusability
- **Importance:** Reusable components help reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
- __Implementation:__ Components can be designed to accept props, allowing them to be used in different contexts with varying data.

### Props
- **Definition:** Props are short for properties and are used to pass data from one component to another.
- __Usage:__ By utilizing props, components can be made dynamic and customizable based on the data they receive.

### JSX
- __JSX:__ Jsx is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript (e.g., it may output dynamic content).

- __Usage:__ JSX makes it easier to create React elements and components, providing a clearer structure for your UI.

### State
-  State is a built-in object that allows components to create and manage their own data. It is mutable and can be updated in response to user actions.
- __Usage:__ State is essential for building interactive applications where the UI needs to change based on user input or other events.
